# Thermistor

A thermistor is a thermal resistor, meaning that it is a electrical resistor whoch changes resistance with temperature.There are two types of thermistors:

* NTC, or Negative Termperature Coefficient
* PTC, the Positive Temperature Coefficient

We can draw a thermistor drawing a resistor and circoling it around. We can use an arrow or we can specify if it's rather an NTC or a PTC

## PTC

 We saw erlier that the resistance of a metal typically increases as its temperature icreases and that was because the atoms started to vibrate which makes itharder for an electron to flow thorugh the materia without colliding.

 The ptc tyope thermister behaves something like this. We call it positive vecase if we plotted the resistance with temperature then we get an upwrap trend showing an increases in resistance with temperautre.

 As the temperature goes up, the resistance goes up as well.

### Usage of PTC

Most commonly used for circuit protection

The PTC as application in fuses because let's say we have a circuit and if too much current flow through the circuit the fuse may blow and you may have to replace it. But using a PTC thermistor it's like a resettable fuse. You don't have to replace it.

Let's say we have a circuit and the voltage across the PTC resistor is too high. This means that there is a lo of current flowing through it. When a current slowing through the resisitor is high, the resistor heats up. In this case the resistance of the PTC increses making the current decreasing. The PTC limits the amount of current flowing through it.

## NTC

The other type is the NTC or negative temperature coefficient. With this tupe we use a semiconductor which behaves a little differently. As you might guess we call it a negative temperature coefficiente because when we plot the resistance / temperature this type will actialy decrease in resistance. So when the temperture increases, the resistance decreases. The corve is non-linear, it is more like an inversely exponential

This is to do with the strucurre of the aotm of the material. If we look at a siplified atom of a metal we have the nucleous at the centre an then a numer of electrons all on differente orbital shells.

### Functioning

#### Conductor

A conductor has one to three elecotrons in its outermost or valence shell. Each shell holds a miximum number of electrons ad an electron has to have a certain amount of energy to be accepted into each shell. The electrons farthest away from the nucleus have the most energy.

We need electrons to be able to move between other atoms in a material for it to carry electricity. Electrons are held in place by the nuclous. If they can reache the conduction band they can break the free and move. With the metal atom teh conduction band and the valance shell overlap so it's very easy for an electron to became free and move.

#### Insulator

With an insulator the aoutermost valance is packed. Theres very little to no room for an electron to join. The nuclous has a tight grip on the elcotrons and the conduction band is far away so electrons cans't thi and escape therefore electrocy can't flow thorugh this materiale

#### Semiconductor

With a semiconductor there's one too many elecotrns in th eputher shell for it to be conductor so it will nehave as an insulator. As the conduction band is band is quite colse if we heat the meterial up some electrons will gaineneought energy to mak the jump and break free from the atom. As more heat is added, more elecotrins move from more atoms and so the materials resistance decreases. So it's basic construction is just a piece of smiconductor between two conductors and this is sealed with protective coating

### Usage of NTC

Most used fro temperature measurement

It is very useful to build temeprature sensors. If you want to build a device that is sensitive to the temperature, that turnos on whent when it's hot end turns off when its too cold. It is possible to use the NTC thermistor.
