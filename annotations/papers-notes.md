# Thermistors

Electrical resistance varies rapidly with temperature. Simple, small, long life and require little maintenace.

## Valence electrons

Valence electrons are crucial for determining the electrical and electrnic properties of materials (cite Gupta20163). The valence electrons that orbits in the valence (or outermost) shell are crucial for the effects that external environment generates on the materiual. Depending on how many they are and how much energy they have the conductiviti of the element may change drastically.

When the valence shell is not complete the valence electrons can be easily detachable: at room temperature the energy is enough to remove the electrons from their parent atom. This electrons are called free electrons. This is why metals have good conductivity, they have lots of free elecrons. 

On the other hand the insulatin materials (wood, glass etc) need a lot of energy to remove the electrons from their atoms and as such they ar not good conductors.

## Materials

Most thermistors are made of semiconductors, it is imporant to discuss them.

The main properties of a semiconductor are realted to the chemical composition and the structure of the material. Semiconductor materials are a category of the numerous types of the Electrical and Electronic enigneering material (cite Gupta20163).

* conductors, which have a great number of electrons in their valence orbit. These electrons are responsible fo the heat and electrical conduction.

* insulators which in the valence orbit have a tight bound to their atom. This means that they need a very large electric field to move one electron from one atom to another

* semiconductors are materiales whose energy gap is between the energy gap of the conductrs and the insulators (silicon). Generally the semiconductors have a negative temperature coefficient

* supercodunctors have extremely low resistance when put in extremely low temperatures.

Other than those there are also megnetic materials, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics and mixed oxides.
