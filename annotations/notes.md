A thermistor is a thermal resistor, meaning that it is a electrical resistor whoch changes resistance with temperature.

Therea re two tupes of thermistors

Ntc, or negative termperature coefficiente and the Ptc, the positive temperature coefficient. We saw erlier that the resistance of a metal typically increases as its temperature icreases and that was because the atoms started to vibrate which makes itharder for an electron to flow thorugh the materia without colliding

The ptc tyope thermister behaves something like this. We call it positive vecase if we plotted the resistance with temperature then we get an upwrap trend showing an increases in resistance with temperautre.

The other type is the NTC or negative temperature coefficient. With this tupe we use a semiconductor which behaves a little differently. As you might guess we call it a negative temperature coefficiente because when we plot the resistance / temperature this type will actialy decrease in resistance

This is to do with the strucurre of the aotm of the material. if we look at a siplified atom of a metal we have the nucleai at the centre an thena a numer of electrons all on differente orbta shell. A conductor has one to three elecotrons in its outermost or valec shell. Each shell holds a miximum number of electrons ad an electron has to have a certain amounto of energy to be accepted into each shell. The elecotrns farthes waya from the nucleus have the most energy. We need electrons to be able to move between other aoms in a material for it to carru electricuty. elecotrns are hel in place by the
