\subsection{Outermost orbit and valence electrons}
As is common knowledge, everything is made out of atoms, every living creature and every unanimated object. An atom is made out of three subatomic particles. The protons (which have a positive electric charge) and the neutrons constitute the nuclei of the atom. The electrons, carrying a negative charge, orbit around the nucleus in distinct orbits.

By observing the figure \ref{fig:atom-structure}, it is possible to distinguish two important types of electrons: the inner electrons, which are
