\vspace{30px}\section{Background}
This chapter focuses on a brief explanation of the physics behind thermistors by introducing and discussing the structure of the atom and the most crucial information that is needed for a better understanding of the topic. Then the attention will be shifted to discussing a specific type of material, known as semiconductors, that are largely utilized for the creation of electric components as far as thermistors. In the end, the document explores the historical progression and development of thermistors, with a particular focus on the NTC type which was the first to be discovered in the first half of the 19th century.


\subsection{Outermost orbit and valence electrons}
As is common knowledge, everything is made out of atoms, every living creature and every unanimated object. An atom is made out of three subatomic particles. The protons (which have a positive electric charge) and the neutrons constitute the nuclei of the atom. The electrons, carrying a negative charge, orbit around the nucleus in distinct orbits.

By observing the figure \ref{fig:atom-structure}, it is possible to distinguish two important types of electrons: the inner electrons, which orbit around the inner shells, and the valence electrons that orbit in the \textbf{valence shell} (also called the outermost orbit). These electrons are crucial for determining the properties of the material \cite{Gupta20163}.

\end{figure}
Particularly depending on how much energy these electrons have, a material is going to be a good conductor rather than a good insulator.

When the outermost orbit is incomplete, valence electrons are separable from the atom. In some cases, at room temperature, there is enough energy to remove these electrons from the orbit. This is the case for most conductive elements like metals (copper, silver and gold) which can easily propagate both electricity and heat. On the other hand, when a great amount of energy is needed to remove one valence electron from the valence orbit, the material is an insulator (also known as dielectric) like wood, glass or rubber \cite{Gupta20163}. 

\subsection{Semiconductor materials}
Other than conductors and dielectric elements there are other types of materials like semiconductors. This particular type of material is rather important to discuss because it is the key element in creating a thermistor. The peculiarity of a semiconductor element is that its conductivity stands between the inductors and the dielectric materials. The most common semiconductor materials are silicon and germanium but it is also used zinc, cadmium, boron and more \cite{Gupta20163}. These types of materials are highly popular because of their properties:

\setlength{\itemsep}{-2px}
    \item They are light weight-wise and small dimension-wise;
    \item They are highly energy-efficient because they work with low voltage;
    \item Long-term degradation effects are insignificant.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Additionally, generally, the semiconductor materials are \textsl{negative temperature coefficient} meaning that their conductivity increases with the temperature, and so the resistivity of the element decreases non-linearly. But this also means that when the temperatures are extremely low (near zero Kelvin) their conductivity properties are comparable to a dielectric material (so their resistance is extremely high).

It is important to note that the semiconductors do not follow Ohm's law. More precisely the current increases much more than the voltage; this peculiarity is used for the BJT transistors. Furthermore, specifically because of the resistivity/temperature curve they are widely used in thermistors, rectifiers, Zener diodes, varistors and photovoltaic cells \cite{Gupta20163}.


\subsubsection*{Other types of materials}
It is worth mentioning that the three types of material aforementioned are not the only ones. The \textsl{superconductors} are materials whose electrical resistivity reaches almost zero when the temperature is greatly below zero Celsius. These materials are usually metals or ceramics \cite{Gupta20163}.

Moreover, there are \textsl{magnetic materials} that can differ in several types depending on their capability of being magnetized by magnetic fields. The diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials have a very low magnetic susceptibility (between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}$) meaning that they are not likely to propagate a magnetic field. Then there are the ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials whose magnetic susceptibility depends on the magnetic field strength. Eventually, there are also antiferromagnetic materials whose susceptibility increases as the temperature increases but when the element reaches a critical temperature, the susceptibility starts decreasing again \cite{Gupta20163}\cite{heck2013magnetic}.

Furthermore, it is also important to mention the \textsl{ferroelectrics} which are a type of material whose natural electric polarization can be changed by the presence of an electric field \cite{Gupta20163}\cite{whatmore2017ferroelectric}.

\subsection{History of thermistors}
On February 21, 1833, Michael Faraday documented the initial observation of the negative temperature coefficient of resistance phenomenon but the in-depth study of this peculiar behavior started almost 100 years later, in the 1930s era.

In 1935 the company Koninklijke Philips Electronics introduced a "novel" NTC material, called \textsl{Starto}, which was a mixture of silicon and clay that aimed to improve room temperature resistance, temperature coefficient of electrical resistance in silicon-based components, and provide easy moldability with superior mechanical properties. The practical outcome of Starto components was not as expected because the resistance was greatly sensitive to the mixing oscillations and the silicon was not evenly distributed in the material causing self-heating and short circuit situations. In the same year, Walter Schottky tried to fabricate a \textsl{thermonegative resistor} made out of ceramic (based on copper oxidize or uranium dioxide) but the results were similar to the Starto components.

By the end of the 1940s, these types of thermistors became extremely popular thanks to Philips Research Laboratories which focused the studies on the pinel-structure ceramics - specifically based on iron oxidize. The laboratories proposed that electrons transition between different positions in the material representing a key development in comprehending the behavior of these materials. The studied materials were analyzed with temperatures up to 300°C, but in 1948, Torok discovered NTC materials that could have been utilized in temperatures up to 1200°C such as chromic oxide. 

Starting in the 1950s, thermistors found application in advanced and sophisticated fields, including aerospace and cryogenic devices. Moreover, in the 1970s additional research about high-temperature NTC ceramics was conducted by Ford, Matsushita Electric, and Siemens. In the early 1990s, university-based research groups played a significant role in advancing NTC ceramics, investigating the aging of electrical properties and exploring innovative processing methods \cite{Feteira2009967}\cite{Becker1947170}.
