Noticeably, the three NTC plots are the exact inverse of the PTC plots due to their opposite functioning. The current-temperature PTC plot (figure \ref{fig:PTC_curr-temp}) is very similar to the NTC voltage-temperature curve (figure \ref{fig:NTC_volt-temp}) and, seemingly, the current-temperature NTC graph (figure \ref{fig:NTC_curr-temp}) is nearly identical to the PTC voltage-temperature diagram (figure \ref{fig:PTC_volt-temp}). The opposite functioning between the two devices can be observed between the voltage-current characteristic curve of the posistor (figure \ref{fig:PTC_curr-volt}) and of the NTC thermistor (figure \ref{fig:NTC_curr-volt}). The two plots are extremely similar with the only difference that the axes are inverted: in the graph \ref{fig:PTC_curr-volt} the y-axis describes the current meanwhile in the curve \ref{fig:NTC_curr-volt} the y-axis characterizes the voltage.

Nonetheless both PTC and NTC thermistors emerge as exceptionally versatile components with widespread applications. PTC thermistors find their niche in scenarios demanding self-regulation, where their inherent ability to modify resistance with temperature ensures stability and reliability. Conversely, the sensitivity of NTC thermistors becomes significantly important in applications requiring precise temperature measurements, aligning seamlessly with the demands of temperature-sensitive systems. The ability of these thermistors to perform dual functions makes them essential tools in many engineering areas, underlining their flexibility and importance in current electronic design.
