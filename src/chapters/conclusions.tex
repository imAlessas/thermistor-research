\vspace{30px}\section{Conclusions}
Noticeably, the three NTC plots are the exact inverse of the PTC plots due to their opposite functioning. The current-temperature PTC plot (figure \ref{fig:PTC_curr-temp}) is very similar to the NTC voltage-temperature curve (figure \ref{fig:NTC_volt-temp}) and, seemingly, the current-temperature NTC graph (figure \ref{fig:NTC_curr-temp}) is nearly identical to the PTC voltage-temperature diagram (figure \ref{fig:PTC_volt-temp}).
